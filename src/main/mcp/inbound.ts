/**
 * The id ChatGPT puts on the HTTP request that carries a tool call.
 *
 * Measured live: the connector request arrives with `x-request-id: wfr_<id>/<suffix>`, and
 * the same `wfr_<id>` is what the page's own message model holds as `metadata.request_id`
 * on the request behind the call. That makes it a deterministic join between a call and the
 * conversation that issued it — no window, no ordering, and no coin toss when two workers
 * call the same tool at the same moment.
 *
 * It has to be carried out of band because the MCP server's own call context does not
 * expose the request headers: live, `mcpCtx.http.headers` is null while the header is
 * plainly there on the socket. So the surface's request handler runs inside this store and
 * the tool dispatch reads it back.
